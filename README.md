## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I got stuck when building the link with arrow icon on the right. Because I did not know how to align an inline-block object. Luckily, I found out that `vertical-align` can do the trick

```css
.arrow {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```
